can i ask you who do you think is going to win in the u s?
i know that you you are nonpartisan as part of your organization.
i think the smart money is that secretary clinton will be the 45th president.
how sure are you about that?
well, the polls are saying it's about 9 out of 10 likely.
i would probably say slightly less than that, just because we've learnt, between the columbia referendum and the brexit vote, to have a little bit of humility and modesty about pools;
but i'd say it's till probably 7 or 8 out of 10 likely.
ok, if trump does managed to surprise everybody, what will that mean for foreign policy, do you think?
well, that's so hard to know because he's so far outside the post world war ii mainstream of american foreign policy;
he question some of the basics from free trade to u s relations with our allies in europe and asia;
seems to have a slightly more relaxed approach to the possible spread of nuclear weapons.
now, it's a little bit hard to know what's rhetoric and what would be policy.
also, very hard to know who would populate trump administration.
one thing i expect your viewers don't know is every american president gets to make something on the order of 4000 appointments across the american government, so it's an enormous pool of individuals who could shape things;
but all things being equal you're looking at a form of economic nationalism and much more wariness about geopolitical involvement in the world.
and what is your thought on that how alarming is it, as its opponents will say?
well, it worries me.
i believe the united states do rise benefit, not just economically and strategically from free trade, i believe the alliance system has done us extraordinary good.
it's kept the peace in europe;
it's kept things for the most part calm in asia;
the world is growing economically;
we haven't seen message spread of nuclear weapons.
so i believe mr trump focuses too much on what he sees is the cost of america's involve on the world;
he doesn't focus nearly enough of what i would describe as the return on investment.
i know you've written obviously a lot on foreign policy, if hillary clinton does win, how different would she be from barack obama and from her husband?
how much more interventionist do you think she would be?
i would think slightly more interventionist that barack obama, you're probably see you in a little bit more muscular policy in ukraine;
possibly a little bit more muscular policy against north korea, which is getting very close to having nuclear warheads on missiles that can reach the united states;
probably in the middle east.
she will have to be a little bit more muscular in syria;
i would think perhaps the creation of one or more so called safe areas where syrian people could live and return too.
how much is foreign policy playing apart at all you think people are voting or is it all the best it can knows?
just the new york very recently last month and it didn't seem to be featuring much, apart from, you know, the whole security terror threat.
very little.
such as foreign policy, even domestic policy, this is the most personality driven and dominated campaign i've ever seen in my lifetime.
we're talking about character, temperament, fitness for office, very little about the differences on tax policy or education policy, very little.
and how damaging do the american reputation around the world has the debate being?
it has been damaging.
people i don't care so much in whether people on the world like the united states, but i want them to respect the united states, and i want them to want to emulate us in terms of the kind of economy we operate;
our politics, how we carry them out;
the basic freedoms and so forth;
and i can't think this, i cannot think this campaign has been good for the american brand.
and when we look at the strengthening position of russia, for example, and the mess that is the middle east, can any u s president really find a solution to the middle east?
and what do you think about the american allegiance with, for example, saudi and the other gulf states?
one of the words i'm trying to argue people shouldn't use is solution.
the middle east is not a problem waiting to be solved, it's a condition.
if we're lucky we'll manage it, if we're unlucky we wouldn't be even able to do it that.
i compare to the 30 years war in europe.
so this is a turbulent unraveling middle east it's just gonna grip the new president;
so will the host of problems you've now got in europe;
so will the question of how to manage china's rise to south china's sea in north korea's;
north korea's nuclear program in asia;
it's going to be an extraordinarily crowded, difficult inbox.
it is a very sensitive time, of course.
i just want to turn to one particular area of interest to our viewers in South Asia and that is, of course, the situation in kashmir.
because pakistan and india have accused each other of inflicting fatal casualties in unprovoked firing across the border.
pakistan armies have unk civilians, including a baby girl, was killed when indian troops fired from indian administered kashmir in pakistan punjab province.
indian medias reports set the firing from the other side killed a border guard and a child.
each side said it retaliated and it's impossible to verify the account, or to know who fired first.
well, doctor richard haass, you twitted, i saw today, about the indian - pakistan situation.
has become very tense for those of us with families there, none of us wants to see this escalation intention.
where do you think this is heading?
this is another problem for the door of the newest president.
absolutely, and i'm worried about it.
because, you know, periodically during their mutual histories, india and pakistan have gone to war.
pakistan now has the world's fastest growing nuclear arsenal;
it houses many of the world's most dangerous terrorist;
it's a veneer civilian government but with powerful military and intelligence agencies.
this indian government is not about to turn the other cheek if it sees that pakistan has allowed things to happen or carried them out.
but the unk attack obviously antagonize people cause so many soldiers were killed.
exactly.
so i think the chances, not just of an incident between india and pakistan, even beyond as we've seeing, as high;
and the real challenge is can they manage it?
and i've been involved in efforts with the united states has got they've try to help the two of them manager it, but i actually think that we haven't been paying any attention on south asia, but i'm worried that this is one of those things that could pop up;
and its relationship;
at the height of the cold war, the u s - soviet relationship was for more developed the indian - pakistani relationship is now.
indian politicians have said that pakistan is a terrorist state.
effectively, it is this has been long the accusation that is housing and nurturing terrorist groups, how is the u s intelligence on that, as far as you know?
pakistan is, as best, a weak state;
and it is housing all sorts of terrorists;
and part of the danger is that people that they've been supporting for years in afghanistan have now, it's almost like frankenstein, they've turned around, the taliban.
you not only have the afghan taliban, you have the pakistani taliban, and they are threat to the core pakistan itself, so that's exactly right.
i just want to finish with the fight against the islamic radicals, and what we've been focusing, of course, a lot on mosul and their developments there in the last few days.
is the fight against is have been politically timed so that hillary clinton can't say ok a democratic establishment has done?
i don't buy that for a second, because no.
i  don't buy that for a second, because in part, you know, how does this fight is gonna go.
and if it goes badly, it can hurt hillary clinton;
and donald trump is already saying we never should have pulled u s forces out of iraq in the first place, so i don't think it has anything to do with that.
sooner or later, unk mosul will be liberated but that's when they really difficult part begins.
already we see turkey, we see iran, we see the iraqi government, we see the kurds, and we see others;
there's no consensus about how mosul, more broadly, how iraq is to iran.
what's going to be the role of the shia militias, and so forth?
how are the unk fair?
so, one of the lessons we have to be learned by now is: the military phase, as difficult as it is, is never as difficult is the follow-up days.
i feel were about to learn that at mosul yet again.
just in a sentence, are you an optimistic about where we are?
because it seems that it's all full out of threats on the horizon.
at the risk of being self referential, my next book is called a world in disarray, i think that tells you what you need to know! doctor richard hass, thank you very much.
thank you.
